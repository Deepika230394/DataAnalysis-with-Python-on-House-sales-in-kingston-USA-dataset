# DataAnalysis-with-Python-on-House-sales-in-kingston-USA-dataset
Performed various data analysis steps like Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data analysis, Model Development,Model Evaluation and refinement on given dataset

Steps performed:
1. Imported the dataset using pandas
2. In the data wrangling process, dropped some unused columns,found some missing values and replace those with mean. 
3. In data exploratory analysis, Using seaborn library drew boxplot and regplot to check given conditions
4. In data model development, used regression model and calculated R^2 and created a pipeline object
5. Lastly using skilearnmodel's train_test_split splitted the data for testing and used Ridgeregression on training dataset. And performed a second order polynomial transform on both the training data and testing data.
